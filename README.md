# PingMonitor
Keeps track of when a host goes online and offline.

This tool is usable via the command prompt or by normally opening it. It accepts an argument for the host, while you will be asked for it if you do not specify.

Upon entry of a host, it will continually ping the host to check if it goes online/offline at any time, and reports it in the output. Since it also says the time that the host changed its availability, it could be quite useful!
